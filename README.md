# âœ¨ 2023 Coding Enhancement âœ¨

## ðŸ§¸ About this Repo

Created to,

1. Enhance up my coding skills (C++)
2.  Keep up with algorithm problems
3. Enhance my code performance
4. Practice managing branches, commits, and use vi editor


## ðŸ§¸ Goals

1. Use following features when solving algorithm problemos

    * lamda expression
    * pointers/unique pointers instead of dx, dy array
    *   Thread (if possible so i can practice life cycles)
    * C+11 features ( NO MORE C STYLE CODING !!!) 

2. Use vi editors for
    * small changes
    * commit
3. Try to avoid GUI/sourcetree and get used to linux environment development

4. Try to commit everyday
    * This doesnt mean solving one problem per day.
    * Quantity <<<<< Quality 
    * GET MOTIVATED

5. Compare with previous coding methods
    * Compare code performances and learn through my codes
